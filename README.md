# 🏦 Smart Lender – Loan Eligibility Prediction System

An intelligent Machine Learning-based web application that predicts loan eligibility using applicant information and assists financial institutions in making faster, more accurate, and data-driven lending decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Smart Lender is a Machine Learning-based web application developed to predict the eligibility of loan applicants. The system automates the loan approval process by analyzing applicant information and predicting whether a loan should be **Approved** or **Rejected**.

The application compares multiple classification algorithms and integrates the **best-performing model (XGBoost)** into a **Flask** web application for real-time loan prediction.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional loan approval processes require extensive manual verification, making them time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies.

Smart Lender addresses this challenge by automating credit risk assessment using Machine Learning, enabling banks and financial institutions to:

- Reduce manual effort
- Improve decision accuracy
- Minimize lending risks
- Speed up loan approvals
